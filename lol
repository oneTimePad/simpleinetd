1) I am the Team Lead/Software Lead for the Rutgers Student Unmanned Aerial Systems team. We  develope an autonomous UAV for 
"search-and-rescue" like missions. On the team, I have dealt with:  full-stack web-application development  in Django, computer 
vision in OpenCV, Android development, setting up Local-area networks and wireless data links.

2) I am interested in Cyber-Security and I have some background and experience (learned on my own time), but I am not 
necessarily comfortable being interviewed about it. I have done some projects in the subject: developed open-source VoIP SRTP 
patch utilizing the One-Time Pad. I designed a True Random Number Generator utilizing  sampling of natural phenomena for the 
project. I did not do the programming of the patch; the programming was outsourced. This project received multiple awards at 
the New Jersey Regional Science Fair in High School. I have also done a few CTF/Boot2Root challenges online, read security 
books, and host a small unoffical security club at my university. I also made a project called "JSZombie", a simple Javascript 
zombie controller for educational purposes, utilizing Django.

3) I have worked on small systems programming projects in C Linux: simple mimic of Bash shell, simple mimic of the Inet daemon, 
and a few other client-server programs. I am reading "The Linux Programming Interface" by Michael Kerrisk. I am interested in 
Linux Systems programming too, and potentially learning to program for  the Linux Kernel.
